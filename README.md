##Motivation
 For the past couple of years, due to increasing online shopping and rent cost, offline
stores have been tremendously threatened â€“ Pandemic made this problem worse.
Now companies have started looking for more desirable way to attract people be
that online or in-store.//
 Number of returns have also been increased because of lack of try on as they would
have in offline shopping. Therefore, customers find it confusing and difficult to select
appropriate style and suitable colour of garment for them.//
