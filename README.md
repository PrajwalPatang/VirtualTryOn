## Motivation
 For the past couple of years, due to increasing online shopping and rent cost, offline
stores have been tremendously threatened â€“ Pandemic made this problem worse.
Now companies have started looking for more desirable way to attract people be
that online or in-store.

 Number of returns have also been increased because of lack of try on as they would
have in offline shopping. Therefore, customers find it confusing and difficult to select
appropriate style and suitable colour of garment for them.

## Objectives
- Achieve Virtual Try-On
- Perform realistic rendering of clothes

## Problem Statement

Design an end-to-end pipeline such that given a pair of target cloth and person image,
generate an output image of the person wearing the target cloth

## How would this be helpful?
-  Virtual try-on technology helps customer to try products which they like using their
own camera devices. This will help the customer to try the product in several ways
for selecting the style and size fit before purchasing
-  According to a report by Statista, in 2017 the worth of AR market was 3.5 billion
dollars but now developing exponentially and may reach up to 198 billion dollars
by 2025.
- Virtual Try-On let customers to judge how certain product looks on them before
they really buy the item. This give customers the complete liberty of selecting products at their own comfort, without actually
feeling pressurized about buying something and later regretting about it.

    This concept of virtual try-on can be used by online stores and help their costumers know
how they would look in that attire. Collecting the appropriate data of both target cloth
and image is necessary towards which we are working. Also this project is useful for online
shopping enthusiasts to reduce their time and number of returns. This Virtual Try-On
can be extended to 3D and real-time also.
